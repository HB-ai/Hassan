# Hassan
I am Hassan Banda, currently working for the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR). The work I do involves coordination of the ICGLR Pact on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes Region. The ICGLR is an Inter-Governmental Organisation comprising twelve (12) countries: Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. I am interested in programming although I don't have much knowledge about programming. However, I would want to use the programming knowledge for data mining as I also have keen interest in data-science.
